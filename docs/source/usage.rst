Service Discovery
-----------------

Once the cluster is up and running, all microservices
register automatically to Consul. The consul UI can
be reached at http://<host>:8500/ui.


You can discover them as follows:

.. code-block:: console
		
    $ curl http://<host>:8500/v1/catalog/services
    {"consul":[],"lastreadbooks":["books","last"],"newbook":["books","new"]}

You can then obviously query Consul to discover more about
a specific service:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl http://<host>:8500/v1/catalog/service/newbook
    [{"Node":"disco","Address":"172.19.0.2","ServiceID":"newbook1","ServiceName":"newbook","ServiceTags":["books","new"],"ServiceAddress":"172.19.0.5","ServicePort":8080,"ServiceEnableTagOverride":false,"CreateIndex":5,"ModifyIndex":5}]

Or seen via DNS:

.. code-block:: console

    $ dig @0.0.0.0 -p 8600 newbook.service.consul SRV

    ; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-11ubuntu1.2-Ubuntu <<>> @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 newbook.service.consul SRV
    ; (1 server found)
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; Got answer:

    ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 140

When terminating the service, the service will automatically
deregisters itself.

REST API
--------

All the calls of the REST API are executed against
the gateway running on port 8000.

The API is self documented through a
`Swagger spec <http://swagger.io/>`_ and available
at http://<host>:8000/apidocs/index.html.


.. warning::

   The API is far from being exhaustive. It will be
   augmented as new services are implemented. Let's
   recall this is a learning exercise.
   

.. http:post:: /bookshelf/books

   is returned with its internal id set.
